<h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>
<p>
    This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that
    I have read over the years.<br>

    Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad,
    grilled meats and pitta breads.<br>
</p>
<h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2><br>
<ol>
    <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>

    <li>175g of tahini</li>

    <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>

    <li>Half a red pepper</li>

    <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>

    <li>1 clove of garlic</li>

    <li>A dash of olive oil</li>

</ol>
<h2>Instructions</h2><br>
<ul>
    <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>

    <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>

    <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>

    <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste.</li>

    <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>

    <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>

</ul>
<p>
    For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime
    and<br>
    chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.<br>
</p>
<h2>Storage</h2> <br>
<p>
    Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've
    made<br>
    it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.<br>
